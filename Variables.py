•Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name,
 so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. 
 •It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. 
 •Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory.  
 •This data can then be used throughout our program.
 •As Python is Dynamically typed language there is no need to use data types explicitly
 while creating the variable. •Depends on the value that 
we initialise interpreter decides its data type and allocates memory accordingly.
