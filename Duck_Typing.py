Duck Typing is a way of programming in which an object passed into a function or
method supports all method signatures and attributes expected of that object at run time.
The object's type itself is not important.
â€¢Rather, the object should support all methods/attributes called on it.
For this reason, duck typing is sometimes seen as "a way of thinking rather than a type system". 

In duck typing, we don't declare the argument types in function prototypes or methods.
 This implies that compilers can't do type checking.
